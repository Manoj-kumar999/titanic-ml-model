## 📂 Project Structure

- `titanic_model.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with complete data preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, and model training.
- `data/` – (Optional) Folder where dataset files like `train.csv` and `test.csv` can be stored.
- `README.md` – This file.

## 🔧 Features & Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handled missing values (`age`, `embarked`, `fare`)
   - Converted categorical columns using `pd.get_dummies`

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyzed survival rates based on different features like gender, class, and age

3. **Model Building**
   - Trained various classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, etc.)
   - Evaluated using accuracy score and confusion matrix

4. **Data Encoding**
   - Used `get_dummies()` for categorical variables
   - Aligned train and test datasets with missing categories handled
